# KAN - Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

This repository contains the implementation and exploration of **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**, a neural network architecture inspired by the **Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem**. This theorem states that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a finite superposition of univariate functions and a single two-variable function. 
The Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks leverage this powerful mathematical framework to create efficient and interpretable machine learning models.
